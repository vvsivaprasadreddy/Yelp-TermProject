The data was available in kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelpdataset
. The dataset was available in Json format. We downloaded the files in json
format and converted them to csv. We used the files, business.csv, user.csv and
review.csv to create our dataset.
We used these particular files since they contained:
? business.csv: business attributes, business categories, business ids and city
? user.csv: user id, average stars
? review.csv: user id, business id, text, date, useful, cool, funny
